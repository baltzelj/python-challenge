## Module 3 challenges
### PyBank
Within the PyBank challenge, I have the output text (referred to as the [analysis.txt](PyBank/analysis.txt)), the data that my code pulls from ([budget_data.csv](PyBank/budget_data.csv)), and the code itself ([main.py](PyBank/main.py)). I also have a [rough draft](PyBank/rough.ipynb) that I used from Jupyter notebook to run the code and check its functionality.
### PyPoll
The second folder, PyPoll, contains the three main files that I used for my code ([election_data.csv](PyPoll/election_data.csv), [main.py](PyPoll/main.py), and [analysis.txt](PyPoll/analysis.txt)). I also have my [rough draft](PyPoll/poll_draft.ipynb) that I used during work.
