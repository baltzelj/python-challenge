## Module 3 challenges
### PyBank
Within the PyBank challenge, I have the output text (referred to as the [analysis.txt]((https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/edit/main/README.md#:~:text=.DS_Store-,analysis,-.txt))), the data that my code pulls from ([budget_data.csv]((https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/edit/main/README.md#:~:text=analysis.txt-,budget_data,-.csv))), and the code itself ([main.py](https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/main.py)). I also have a roughdraft that I used from Jupyter notebook to run the code and check its functionality.
### PyPoll
The second folder, PyPoll, contains the three main files that I used for my code ([election_data.csv]([url](https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/election_data.csv)), [main.py]([url](https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/main.py)), and [analysis.txt]([url](https://github.com/baltzelj/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/analysis.txt))). I also have my rough draft that I used during work.
